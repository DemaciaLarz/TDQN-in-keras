# Implementing TDQN in Keras

## Summary
The objective of this project was to implement the TDQN algorithm on a set of stocks from the upcoming hydrogen sector. 

We ended up applying it to historical gold prices for the initial training, and then quite successfully to one hydrogen stock, Powercell Sweden. Here are some nice results:
