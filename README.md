# Implementing TDQN in Keras
Consider as the basis of this project the Trading Deep Q-Network algorithm (TDQN) as it is put forward in the paper named: An Application of Deep Reinforcement Learning to Algorithmic Trading which you can find [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06627).

## Summary
The objective of this project was to implement the TDQN algorithm on a set of stocks from the upcoming hydrogen sector. 

We ended up applying it to historical gold prices for the initial training, and then quite successfully to one hydrogen stock, Powercell Sweden. Here are some nice results:
